<b>B      Used to design or test electronic circuits</b>         
C      A code-converting circuit        
D      A temporary binary storage area         
<br>
  

Q2. What is the gap that separates two sides of the breadboard called?

A     The dip  
B      The rail  
C      The switch  
<b>D      The ravine</b>  
<br>
  

Q3. Similarity between PCB and Bread board is

A     Both allow to design temporary circuits.  
B     Both can be used for solderless components.  
<b>C     Complex circuits can be designed on both.</b>  
D     Both can handle high current.  
<br>
  

Q4. The conductive metal strips on a breadboard

A     Contain bus strips commonly used for power connections.  
B     Provide socket strips in the build area to hold components.  
C     Are conductive with low resistance.  
<b>D     All of the above</b>  
<br>
  

Q5. When connecting bus or socket strips the jumper wires should be

<b>A     Long enough to make the connection yet short enough to prevent complications.</b>  
B     Wrapped in a coil to prevent interference with the other components.  
C     As long at the test instrument’s leads to decrease resistance.  
D     Soldered to the components to ensure conductivity.  
<br>
  

Q6. Breadboards allow for prototyping an electrical circuit without the need to solder the components.

<b>B     Never assume the test equipment and components are functional.</b>  
C     Ignore any burn marks as you are only experimenting on the circuit.  
D     Assume all jumper wires and connectors are intact.
